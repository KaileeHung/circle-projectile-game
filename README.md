# circlegame
A simple circle projectile game made for ICS 111 (introductory Java course) where the player controls a circle and has to dodge other projectiles. The game ends when the player hits a projectile enemy. This was made using the software sketchbook [Processing](https://processing.org/). The game consists of the player (small blue circle) and the following **three types of enemies** spawning at random times:
 - Common **dark purple circle** projectiles which enter and leave the game window. They spawn at random locations, and have random velocities
 - Smaller **pink circle** projectiles which are slightly rarer, and bounce off the edges of the game window, staying in the game until it ends. There is a maximum of 3 that have a possibility of spawning
 - A **stalker** identical to the common enemy that slowly moves toward the player and follows it around. There is only a maximum of 1 stalker that can spawn
