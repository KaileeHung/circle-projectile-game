A simple circle projectile game made for ICS 111 where the player controls a circle and has to dodge other circles. This was made using the software sketchbook Processing. The game consists of the player (small blue dot) and three types of enemies. The first is the bigger dark purple circle enemies that despawn when they hit the edge of the screen. The second is the small pink circle enemies that bounces off the edges of the game window. The third is a stalker that slowly moves toward the player so they don't sit still.
